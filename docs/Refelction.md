# Reflection
This independent project on physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling of propranolol was undertaken using Berkeley Madonna, with all organ-level differential equations derived from first principles. Through the construction and validation of rat (IV) and human (IV & PO) models, I gained practical experience in mechanistic model building, parameterisation, and quantitative evaluation of model performance.

The rat IV model achieved high accuracy, with AAFE values around 1.3–1.5 and all major pharmacokinetic parameters (t½, CL, Vss, AUC) predicted within 2-fold of in vivo data, demonstrating reliability of the framework. In contrast, human IV and PO simulations highlighted key limitations: while exposure metrics such as AUC and CL were predicted within 2-fold, discrepancies emerged in parameters like Tmax, Vss, and t½. These issues were traced to simplified absorption modeling and omission of transporter- or enzyme-specific processes. Because it was my first time constructing PBPK model, I started with the simplest model, in the future, absorption model must be developed to reflect more complex real-life absorption mechanism. 

Overall, this project not only established a validated baseline model (rat IV) but also outlined a roadmap for refinement of human models. Future improvements include incorporating gastric emptying and intestinal transit into the oral absorption module, refining hepatic clearance scaling, and integrating transporter and enzyme dynamics. Beyond the technical results, the project provided an opportunity to gain knowledge of the mechanism behind PBPK model, practice complete ODE derivation, systematic model validation using fold-error criteria (FE, AAFE, within 2×/3×), and critical evaluation of mechanistic assumptions.

This exercise reflects both the strengths and challenges of PBPK modeling: while exposure-based predictions can often be achieved with reasonable accuracy, faithfully reproducing shape-dependent parameters such as Tmax and terminal half-life requires deeper biological detail. The project therefore serves as both a validated case study and a platform for future extensions toward clinically predictive PBPK modeling.
