# Reflection
This independent project on physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling of propranolol was conducted using Berkeley Madonna, with all organ-level differential equations derived from first principles. By constructing and validating healthy rat (IV) and healthy human (IV and PO) models, I developed hands-on experience in mechanistic model building, parameterisation, and quantitative evaluation of model performance.

The project successfully validated the rat IV and human IV and PO models - all three models showed consistent agreement with literature data. While the models are already predictive, the models were quite simplified as it was a first attempt at PBPK modeling. Therefore, future improvements including incorporating gastric emptying and intestinal transit into the oral absorption module and integrating transporter and enzyme dynamics should be done to reflect more complex in vivo mechanism.

Beyond the technical implementation, this project strengthened my understanding of PBPK mechanisms, provided practice in complete ODE derivation, and reinforced systematic model validation using fold-error metrics (FE, AAFE, within 2×/3×).

Overall, this project demonstrates validated, mechanism-based PBPK modeling across species and routes, and also provides a foundation for future extensions toward clinically predictive PBPK modeling.
