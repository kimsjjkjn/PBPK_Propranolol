# Discussion
## Rat IV Model
The rat IV model showed excellent performance, with an AAFE of 1.49 based on the time–concentration profile and an AAFE of around 1.3 based on the PK parameters (both digitised and literature in vivo data). All major pharmacokinetic parameters (t½, CL, Vss, AUC) were predicted within 2-fold of both digitised and literature values. Generally, an AAFE within 2-fold is considered good validation for building robust PBPK models (Deepika et al., 2023). Therefore, this result indicates that the constructed rat IV model is reliable and well validated.

## Human IV Model
Although the comparison with digitised in vivo data yielded an AAFE of 1.28 based on the time–concentration profile and 1.78 based on PK parameters, comparison with literature values gave a higher AAFE of 2.65. It is generally more appropriate to benchmark against actual literature data rather than digitised estimates, as digitised values may not fully reflect observed in vivo data (except where digitisation is unavoidable, such as for time–concentration profiles). Prediction error within 3-fold is widely accepted as informative but less reliable than within 2-fold. It is often regarded as moderate accuracy, sometimes acceptable for screening or early development, but usually insufficient for confident clinical application. Therefore, the AAFE of 2.65 based on PK parameters when compared with literature indicates that the model is not reliably predictive in humans. More specifically, while AUC and CL were reproduced reasonably well (within 2-fold), other key parameters including Cmax, Tmax, Vss, and t½ showed large discrepancies (e.g., Cmax was overpredicted by about 3 fold). In particular, the overestimation of Vss and t½ suggests that human IV pharmacokinetics were not adequately captured. Thus, although the human IV model shows partial agreement, it is not clinically predictive.


## Human PO Model
The human PO model showed an AAFE of 1.76 based on the time–concentration profile and 1.48 based on PK parameters when evaluated against digitised PK parameters. Against published literature values, overall error slightly increases (AAFE = 1.88), though it is still within 2-fold. As with the IV case, comparison with literature data is more meaningful. An AAFE under 2-fold is generally considered acceptable and indicates a reasonably reliable PBPK model. More specifically, while most parameters (Tmax, Cmax, AUC, and F) were well predicted (within 2-fold), t½ was not well reproduced, being overestimated by about 5-fold. In addition to that, although Tmax was within 2-fold, it's slightly earlier than literature value. Largely mismatched t½ and slightly earlier Tmax may be due to overly simplified absorption model that does not account for factors such as gastric emptying, intestinal transit, or reabsorption/secretion. In conclusion, although the human PO model overall demonstrates acceptable prediction, it is not sufficiently predictive for t½.

| **Human PO** |                     1.76 |         1.48 (digitised), **1.88 (literature)** | Cmax, Tmax, AUC, F within 2×        | t½ overestimated (~5×)    | Acceptable fit overall. Exposure (AUC, F) well predicted but t½ largely overestimated potentially due to oversimplified absorption model.   |
